# Concrete-Toolchanger
My senior thesis project from Princeton consisted of developing a multi-material concrete 3D-printer.

Using an E3D TOolchanger as the base motion system, custom concrete and silicone extruders were developed to be compatible with the toolchanging system.
A system for reliably priming the polymer Hemera extruders was also developed. The mechanics and electronics were controlled using a Duet board and RRF3,
which allowed for all of the toolchanging procedures and material interactions to be controlled by macros. Additionally, rather than using a traditional
slicer, FullControlGCode was used to create parametric toolpaths tailored to each type of extruder. Together, silicone and polymers were combined with
cement and mortar to create new concrete multi-materials with augmented material properties.
